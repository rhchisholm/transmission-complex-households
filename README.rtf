\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 This repository contains MATLAB code needed to generate all figures in Chisholm et al. \'93A model of population dynamics with complex household structure and mobility: implications for transmission and control of communicable diseases.\'94
\b0 \
\
There are 48 transmission scenarios considered in the paper.  For each scenario, we generate 1000 samples from the parameter space using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).  \
\
For each LHS sample, we run the simulation model three times:\
\
1. To explore an unmitigated outbreak\
2. To explore an outbreak where a household-based prophylaxis intervention is administered throughout and is 100% effective\
3. To explore an outbreak where a household-based prophylaxis intervention is administered throughout and is 50% effective\
\

\b First, we initialise every simulation by running: lhs_initialise_simulations.m
\b0 \
\
This script calls:\
- lhs_sample_generation.m (which samples parameter space using LHS)\
- parameters_basenc.m (which defines all population parameter values)\
- parameters_infection.m (which defines all pathogen-related parameter values)\
- initialise_demographicsns.m (which initialises age and household structure of population)\
- initialise_agents.m (which initialises all infection and immunes status of population)\
\
And it outputs 6 files: Initialisation_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6), each of which stores initialisation data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios.  \
\

\b Second, run simulation batches.

\i \cf0 1. For unmitigated outbreaks
\i0 , run:  batch_run_lhs.m\
\
This script:\
- loads Initialisation_Sx.mat\
- calls simulator1nc.m (this simulates an unmitigated outbreak for each LHS sample)\
- outputs 6 files: batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6), each of which stores outbreak data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios, which are used to generate the figures and data for tables in the manuscript\
\

\i 2. For mitigated outbreaks with 100% effective intervention
\i0 , run: batch_run_lhs_int.m with \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Effectiveness_intervention = 1; (at line 3)

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \
This script:\
- loads Initialisation_Sx.mat\
- calls simulator1nc_int.m (this simulates a mitigated outbreak for each LHS sample)\
- outputs 6 files: batch_int_Sx_100.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6), each of which stores outbreak data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios, which are used to generate the figures and data for tables in the manuscript\
\

\i 3. For mitigated outbreaks with 50% effective intervention
\i0 , run: batch_run_lhs_int.m with \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Effectiveness_intervention = 0.5; (at line 3)

This script:\

\b Third, create figures.
\b0 \
\

\i 1. For unmitigated outbreak figures
\i0 , first run: unmitigated_outbreak_prevalence_figures.m\
\
This script:\
- loads batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6)\
- makes 4 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the prevalence of infection assuming fluid versus stable dwelling occupancy, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: \
	\cf2 i. N = 2500, no event-based migration\
	ii. N = 2500, with event-based migration\
	iii. N = 500, no event-based migration\
	iv. N = 500, with event-based migration
\f1 \cf0 \

\f0 \
Then run: unmitigated_outbreak_contacts_figures.m\
\
This script:\
- loads batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6)\
- makes 2 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the total number of contacts, and the total number of unique contacts of infectious people  assuming fluid, fluid (with event-based migration) and stable dwelling occupancy, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: \
	\cf2 i. N = 2500\
	ii. N = 500\cf0 \
\

\i 2,3. For mitigated outbreak figures
\i0 , first run: mitigated_outbreak_prevalence_figures.m\
\
This script:\
- loads batch_int_Sx_100.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6) and batch_int_Sx_50.mat (where x =1,2,\'85,6)\
- makes 8 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the prevalence of infection assuming fluid versus stable dwelling occupancy, with and without the intervention, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: \
	\cf2 i. N = 2500, no event-based migration, 100% effective intervention\
	ii. N = 2500, with event-based migration, 100% effective intervention\
	iii. N = 500, no event-based migration, 100% effective intervention\
	iv. N = 500, with event-based migration, 100% effective intervention\cf0 \
	\cf2 v. N = 2500, no event-based migration, 50% effective intervention\
	vi. N = 2500, with event-based migration, 50% effective intervention\
	vii. N = 500, no event-based migration, 50% effective intervention\
	viii. N = 500, with event-based migration, 50% effective intervention\cf0 \
