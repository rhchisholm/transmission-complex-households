This repository contains MATLAB code needed to generate all figures and tables in Chisholm et al. “A model of population dynamics with complex household structure and mobility: implications for transmission and control of communicable diseases.”

There are 48 transmission scenarios considered in the paper.  For each scenario, we generate 1000 samples from the parameter space using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).  

For each LHS sample, we run the simulation model three times:

1. To explore an unmitigated outbreak
2. To explore an outbreak where a household-based prophylaxis intervention is administered throughout and is 100% effective
3. To explore an outbreak where a household-based prophylaxis intervention is administered throughout and is 50% effective

First, we initialise every simulation by running: lhs_initialise_simulations.m

This script calls:
- lhs_sample_generation.m (which samples parameter space using LHS)
- parameters_basenc.m (which defines all population parameter values)
- parameters_infection.m (which defines all pathogen-related parameter values)
- initialise_demographicsns.m (which initialises age and household structure of population)
- initialise_agents.m (which initialises all infection and immunes status of population)

And it outputs 6 files: Initialisation_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,…,6), each of which stores initialisation data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios.  

Second, run simulation batches.

1. For unmitigated outbreaks, run:  batch_run_lhs.m

This script:
- loads Initialisation_Sx.mat
- calls simulator1nc.m (this simulates an unmitigated outbreak for each LHS sample)
- outputs 6 files: batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,…,6), each of which stores outbreak data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios, which are used to generate the figures and data for tables in the manuscript

2. For mitigated outbreaks with 100% effective intervention, run: batch_run_lhs_int.m with 
Effectiveness_intervention = 1; (at line 3)

This script:
- loads Initialisation_Sx.mat
- calls simulator1nc_int.m (this simulates a mitigated outbreak for each LHS sample)
- outputs 6 files: batch_int_Sx_100.mat (where x =1,2,…,6), each of which stores outbreak data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios, which are used to generate the figures and data for tables in the manuscript

3. For mitigated outbreaks with 50% effective intervention, run: batch_run_lhs_int.m with 
Effectiveness_intervention = 0.5; (at line 3)

This script:
- loads Initialisation_Sx.mat
- calls simulator1nc_int.m (this simulates a mitigated outbreak for each LHS sample)
- outputs 6 files: batch_int_Sx_50.mat (where x =1,2,…,6), each of which stores outbreak data for 8 batches of transmission scenarios, which are used to generate the figures and data for tables in the manuscript

Third, create figures.

1. For unmitigated outbreak figures, first run: unmitigated_outbreak_prevalence_figures.m

This script:
- loads batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,…,6)
- makes 4 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the prevalence of infection assuming fluid versus stable dwelling occupancy, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: 
	i. N = 2500, no event-based migration
	ii. N = 2500, with event-based migration
	iii. N = 500, no event-based migration
	iv. N = 500, with event-based migration

Then run: unmitigated_outbreak_contacts_figures.m

This script:
- loads batch_Sx.mat (where x =1,2,…,6)
- makes 2 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the total number of contacts, and the total number of unique contacts of infectious people  assuming fluid, fluid (with event-based migration) and stable dwelling occupancy, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: 
	i. N = 2500
	ii. N = 500

2,3. For mitigated outbreak figures, first run: mitigated_outbreak_prevalence_figures.m

This script:
- loads batch_int_Sx_100.mat (where x =1,2,…,6) and batch_int_Sx_50.mat (where x =1,2,…,6)
- makes 8 figures made up of 6 subplots, where each subplot compares the prevalence of infection assuming fluid versus stable dwelling occupancy, with and without the intervention, for one of the 6 transmission scenarios considered, with the population model set to: 
	i. N = 2500, no event-based migration, 100% effective intervention
	ii. N = 2500, with event-based migration, 100% effective intervention
	iii. N = 500, no event-based migration, 100% effective intervention
	iv. N = 500, with event-based migration, 100% effective intervention
	v. N = 2500, no event-based migration, 50% effective intervention
	vi. N = 2500, with event-based migration, 50% effective intervention
	vii. N = 500, no event-based migration, 50% effective intervention
	viii. N = 500, with event-based migration, 50% effective intervention
